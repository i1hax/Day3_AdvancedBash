# Day 3 â€“ Advanced Bash

## Scripts Created
- `check_file.sh`: checks if a file exists (conditionals demo)
- `strings.sh`: string length, substring, replacement demo
- `auto_file_logger.sh`: automation script that logs file existence with timestamp
- `cron_test.log`: cron job demo, appends timestamp every 2 minutes

## Key Topics Practiced
- Conditionals (`if/else`)
- String manipulation (length, substring, replace)
- Cron jobs (task scheduling)
- Automation script basics (logging, file checks)

## Notes
- All scripts tested and running successfully
- Cron job verified via log
- Automation script demonstrates combining conditionals, strings, and cron

## Next Steps
- Continue to Day 4 ( networking fundamentals ,OSI,TCP,IP )
- Expand automation scripts for portfolio
